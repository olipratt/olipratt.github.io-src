Title: About Me

Hi, I'm Oliver Pratt, a Software Engineer living in London.

I work at [Metaswitch](https://www.metaswitch.com/) developing cloud native communications software.

This is where I write about interesting technical projects I work on or topics I learn about. I hope you learn something from reading it!
